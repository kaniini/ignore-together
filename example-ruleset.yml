# This is an example ignore-together ruleset, rulesets are written in a subset of YAML.
# The top level is the name of the rule.  All rules have a "type" field.
# "ignore"-type rules have a set of zero or more "hostmasks" and "accountnames".
# "message"-type rules have a set of regular expressions that are applied to the message.
# A "rationale" field provides an explanation of what the ruleset does,
# so the user may select or deselect the rule in a UI.
